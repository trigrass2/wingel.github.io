This is a post in a series about me poking at the insides of my OWON
SDS7012 oscilloscope.  You might want to start reading at the
[beginning]({{site.baseurl}}/2016/05/01/sds7102-hacking.html).

I've finally managed to convince myself to clean up the source code
for my Linux port and FPGA image for the SDS7102.  You can find all of
it on [GitHub](https://github.com/wingel/sds7102).

Don't look to closely at the MyHDL code though.  I'm still learning
and it's ugly and you might go blind.

The Linux port is a bunch of ugly hacks and quick fixes to get
something running at all on the scope.  And there are traces of my
failed attempt to make a devicetree based port left in there.

I hope that the instructions in the README will be enough to get you
started, if not, just send me a mail and ask.
