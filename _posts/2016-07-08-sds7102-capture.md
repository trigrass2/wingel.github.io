This is a post in a series about me poking at the insides of my OWON
SDS7012 oscilloscope.  You might want to start reading at the
[beginning]({{site.baseurl}}/2016/05/01/sds7102-hacking.html).

I have spent a few weeks learning [MyHDL](http://myhdl.org/) and
building FPGA modules that use the [Wishbone
bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wishbone_(computer_bus)) to talk to
each other.

The first thing I built was a SPI slave which uses the three wires
from the FPGA configuration interface that can be used after
configuration.  A normal SPI interface uses four wires, an active low
Chip Select (/CS), Serial ClocK (SCK), Serial Data Out (SDO) and
Serial Data In (SDI).  SDO is often called Master Out Slave In (MOSI)
and SDI is often called Master In Slave Out (MISO).  Anyway, with only
three wires I had to combine SDO and SDI into one bidirectional wire
SDIO.  I tried to modify Linux spi-gpio driver to use a bidirectional
SDIO pin but couldn't see a simple way to do it so I hacked together a
dumb Linux driver to do it instead.

The SPI slave is a Wishbone bus master and can control a Wishbone
slave connected to it.  I converted my MyHDL code that counted edges
on pins to a Wishbone slave and made that work with the master.  That
was fairly easy.  The hard part was to write a bus multiplexer which
allowed me to connect multiple Wishbone slaves to one Wishbone master.
MyHDL doesn't always work as I expect it to and has a lot of
limitations so it took me a few weeks to make all of that work.

With that done it was fairly easy to create a dual port block RAM in
the FPGA where one port is connected to a Wishbone slave so that the
SoC can read out the data from the block RAM.  The other port is
connected to the ADC.  Using the the ADC clock it captures and stores
the 32 differential ADC signals until the RAM becomes full.  Another
Wishbone slave with a single one bit register is used to stop and
restart the capture.

First capture
=============

I used [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) on a Linux PC to play a 3kHz
sine wave which I then probed with channel one on the scope:

    play -n synth 0 sin 3000

I booted the scope with the OWON firmware and made sure that it showed
a sine wave on the screen.  I then did a soft reset of the CPU in the
SoC and loaded Linux.  Doing a soft reset leaves the ADC running and
this is how I discovered which pins were connected to the ADC to begin
with.  I could also see that the ADC clock was running at 100MHz so I
modified the capture code in the FPGA to only save every 100th sample
to block RAM giving a final sampling rate of 1Msamples/second.

The signals from the ADC consists of 32 differential signals from the
ADC and assigned them to the sets in the same order they appeared in
the FPGA data sheet.  The 32 signals are split up into four sets of 8
bits each.  The ADC can sample one channel and interleave all four
sets or sample two channels and interleave two sets per channel.

This is a plot of the data from the capture.  I have saved the raw
data
[here]({{site.baseurl}}/files/2016-07-08-sds7102-capture/capture.txt).

Red, green, blue and magenta are the four different sets of 8 bits
each.  It doesn't look much like a sine wave, but that's to be
expected.  Having the FPGA signal order match order they are connected
the ADC would have been astonishingly lucky.

There are patterns in the signal through.  A 3kHz sine wave sampled at
1Msamples/second and with 1000 samples in the plot means that the
signal should repeat three times in the capture, and it does.
Something seems to be working at least.

The data mostly looks like random noise but it flattens out every now
and then.  And there are some things in the middle of the noise, that
could be sine wave shaped if I squint a bit and wish really hard.

Positive or negative
====================

After thinking a bit I realised that when I booted Linux some of the
GPIOs changed which in turn switched the attenuation relays in the
analog frontend (AFE) to a different range.  This makes the signal
swing higher and the flat parts is when the signal goes beyond the
limits of the ADC and is clipped to all ones.

And after thinking a bit more I realised that the clipping was a good
thing.  Each differential signal consists of two wires with opposite
polarity.  When routing the wires it is sometimes easier to connect
the positive pin from the transmitter to the negative pin on the
receiver and vice versa.  This makes the PCB layout simpler but means
that the polarity of the signal will be inverted at the receiver.  But
since the signal is clipped and there should have been long stretches
with all ones in the capture data, all bits that were zero in those
stretches are inverted.

Invert those signals in the decoder and plot the capture data again.

Now the flat regions are all ones and the regions in between actually
show some signs of having sine waves in them.

The power of statistics
=======================

What can I do next?  I have a feeling that the lower valued bits of
each 8 bit set of signals will change more often than the higher
valued ones, so why not collect some statistics.  Sort the signals by
the number of transitions and group them four by four.

|Transitions|Signals|
|-|-|
|6|E13 F12 J14 K15|
|18|F10 H13 H15 L14|
|42|D11 G12 G14 M15|
|84|C11 F15 J13 N14|
|173|P15 B14 E15 J11|
|335 - 357|K12 B15 M13 D14|
|358 - 368|B10 R15 T14 C13|
|406 - 427|L12 R14 C15 B12|

A sine wave which repeats 3 times will change the highest valued bit
twice for every repetition which means 2 * 3 = 6 transitions which
matches the first line.  The other lines are multiples of three all
the way up to 173 which is one less than 58 * 3 = 174; the signal is
probably a bit off center compared to the full range.  The number of
transitions for the lowest three bits varies so some of these
transitions are probably lost in noise.

It's still a good start.  Rearrange the bits to match the table above
and reanalyze the capture data:

![Capture with signals sorted by number of transitions]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2016-07-08-sds7102-capture/capture-transitions.png)

Whoa!  That definitely looks like a clipped sine wave.  There is a lot
of noise but it's starting to look decent.

Hmm, what next.  Since all sets of bits contain similar data the ADC
has to be in the mode where it interleaves all four sets for channel
1.  Let's reboot the scope with the OWON firmware and turn on both
channel 1 and channel 2 with the same source signal.  Now two of the
sets should be interleaved for channel 1 and the other two sets should
be interleaved for channel 2.  Back to Linux again and make a new
capture:

![Capture with two channels]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2016-07-08-sds7102-capture/capture-split.png)

The bits for the two channels seem to be a bit mixed up, so let's try
the trick of finding parts of the signal that are clipped signal and
swap around bits between sets until the first two sets are all ones.

![Capture with two channels reordered by clipping]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2016-07-08-sds7102-capture/capture-split-ones.png)

That looks a lot better, the red and green sets are for channel 1, the
blue and magenta sets are for channel 2.  There's an obvious mix-up
between the green and blue sets.  Between samples 80 and 230 the value
of the blue samples are 128 too high and the green samples are 128 too
low.  Swap the bits with value 128 between the sets.

![Capture with two channels with an obvious fix]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2016-07-08-sds7102-capture/capture-split-ones-fixed.png)

This is starting to look decent.  There are still some artefacts down
at the three lowest valued bits but it's not too bad.  I just ended up
swapping the low valued bits around a bit randomly until the plots
looked decent.  This is that I finally ended up with:

![Final Capture]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2016-07-08-sds7102-capture/capture-final.png)

And if I increase the attenuation a bit it looks like this:

![Final Capture with higher attenuation]({{site.baseurl}}/images/2016-07-08-sds7102-capture/capture-attenuation.png)

I think I'm good, each set looks decent now.  I might still have
messed up the order between the sets, what I think is set 1 of channel
1 might actually be set 2 from channel 1.  I'll have to play around a
bit with higher frequency signals later and see if I can figure out if
the order is correct or not.

But I can finally use the scope to capture signals, whee.  My work is done for today.
